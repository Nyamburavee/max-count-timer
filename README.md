Click Counter Timer App
Description
This is a simple React application that combines a click counter with a countdown timer. The app increments a click counter every time a button is pressed, while simultaneously counting down from a set time (10 seconds). When the timer reaches zero, the button is disabled.

Features
Click Counter: Counts the number of times the button is clicked.
Countdown Timer: Starts from 10 seconds and decrements by 1 every second.
Button Disabling: The button is disabled when the timer reaches zero.
